# Kaggle-Competition: Text-Polarity
In this Kaggle Competition, we should be competing in-class to figure out whose methodology could reach the best classification performance. The methodology did not have any restrictions. The dataset was given by the professor, with 2000 training data and 10999 test data. We could submit our result onto Kaggle 3 times maximum per day as limitation.
